## GoLang RESTful API for Book Management

#### This project is a simple RESTful API built using the Go programming language, specifically using the Echo framework for handling HTTP requests and the Bun ORM for database operations. The API allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a resource called "books".

### Endpoints 

- **GET /books**: Retrieves a list of all books.
- **GET /books/{id}**: Retrieves a specific book by its ID.
- **POST /books**: Creates a new book.
- **PUT /books/{id}**: Updates an existing book by its ID.
- **DELETE /books/{id}**: Deletes a book by its ID.

## Getting Started

To get started with the API, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies using `go get`.
3. Set up your database connection details in the configuration file.
4. Run the API using `go run main.go`.
5. You can now send HTTP requests to the specified endpoints.
